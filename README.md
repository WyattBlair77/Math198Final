# Math198Final
A repository containing my results and code for the Math 198 final project.

main.py contains most of the code I used to finish question 2) part h).
I used main.py to generate all of the data shown in the repository.

circular_orbit_test.py is just a test of the code I wrote in main.py to make sure it reproduces the dynamical
system I knew it should.
